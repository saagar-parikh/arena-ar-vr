# ARENA AR VR Interaction

Mixed Reality interaction between AR and VR users
Any room can be scanned and added to the arena scene. Run the scripts below for interaction.

* [ARENA](arenaxr.org)

### Step 1
Scan the room and store the scan mesh in quest.

### Step 2
Generated 3d objects with one of the two methods below
* [Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)
-- Take 300 around photos
-- Ran convert.py to get point clouds
-- Ran train.py to generate splat
* [3D App Lidar](https://3dscannerapp.com/)

### Step 3
Add objects to the arena in one of the scenes. There is also a script (arena_script.py) that adds objects to the arena scene automatically. 

### Step 4
Run mesh_icp.py to localize the virtual objects with physical objects. We need to also git clone arana-py and have three mesh files in the examples folder to solve dependencies.

### Step 5
Run tools/interaction_button.py to include different buttons, display and way of interactions.
